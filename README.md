## Who I am
My name is **Saif Malkshahi** , I am a junior Data Science at [Becode.org](https://becode.org) and I am passionate about AI and Data.

If I would have to describe my character, I would say that I am a little bit a mix of an introvert / extravert.
I like to be surrounded with people but I also appreciate to be alone.
I find it very important to make time for myself each day.        
To practice sport ( like Bodybuilding or Jogging ), enables that I can be with my own and take care of myself. 
I also enjoy to walk alone and listening to interesting podcasts at the same time. 
I can be funny and social but I need to feel comfortable with people first 😄
Besides to do sport, in my free time I really like to read books and to go to event related to art (music events, exhibitions, etc.).
I am also a big fan of technology, space science, artificial intelligence and everything related to them, and I can engage in a whole day's discussion on these topics.

#### One of my favorite Quotes for physicist Carl Sagan:
<h4 align="center"> “Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.” </h4>
