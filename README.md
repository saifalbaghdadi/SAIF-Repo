## Don't judge people before you know them well...
One day during my travels , I was sitting on the train, and there was a young man about 28 years old.
 This young was sitting next to his father the old man.
 Suddenly the young man yelling his father and said, "Dad, look at the trees! They are going backwards!"
 Then the father smiled at his son sympathetically, while all the people sitting on the train looked at the young man with a look of pity, thinking he had a mental illness.
 Minutes later, the young man yelling to his father again: “Dad! Dad… Look at the clouds in the sky, they are catching up with us!”
 The father smiled again, then one of the passengers came to him and said: Why don't take your son to the doctor?
 The father said: I actually took my son to the doctor, and now we are back from the hospital.
 My son was blind and could not see since he was born, only today he regained his sight! "
